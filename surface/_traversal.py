""" Traverse an API heirarchy """


# TODO: import module by name
# TODO: get its global name, and path
# TODO: cache path names to module name for efficiency

# TODO: walk through everything it exposes at the top level
# TODO: eg: names not starting with underscores
# TODO: or anything in the __all__ variable.

# TODO: create a simplified representation of the signatures found (names and types)

# BONUS: collect type information as part of the signatures
# BONUS: traverse heirarchy for specified types, recursively getting their api
# BONUS: so later a type can be compared by value, not just name
